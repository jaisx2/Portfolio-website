            <div class="proj-title">RETAIL BOT</div>
            <div class="proj-des">Designed and built a smart retail bot that follows consumers, 
                scans products using barcode readers, and monitors inventory levels 
                in real-time. Key features include low-stock alerts, theft detection via load sensors, 
                and a smart TFT display showing product availability and location. The system is powered by 
                Arduino and Python, with a web interface for tracking product sales and stock status.</div>

        <div class="projs">
            <div class="proj-title">AI BASED VEHICLE ACCESS CONTROL</div>
            <div class="proj-des">Developed an AI-driven vehicle ignition system that replaces traditional keys with biometric 
                authentication to enhance security and prevent underage driving. It verifies the driverâ€™s license 
                validity and uses real-time face recognition to ensure the driver matches the license holder. 
                Key features include license expiry validation, facial identity verification, and secure 
                ignition control.</div>

        <div class="projs">
            <div class="proj-title">SOUND GLOVES</div>
            <div class="proj-des">Designed smart wearable gloves that enable communication between blind and mute individuals by 
                translating hand gestures into audible speech. Powered by flex sensors to detect finger movements, 
        the system converts predefined gestures into voice output. Key features include real-time gesture recognition, 
                voice conversion, and user-friendly wearable design.</div>

            <div class="proj-title">FAKE PRODUCT REVIEW SYSTEM</div>
            <div class="proj-des">Developed a machine learning-based system in Python to identify and filter fake product reviews on e-commerce
                 platforms.It analyzes behavioral patterns, repetition, and linguistic features to detect suspicious reviews. 
                Key features include review classification, behavioral analysis, and automated flagging for improved 
                review authenticity.</div>
